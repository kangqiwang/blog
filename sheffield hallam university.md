include the identification of key factors intrinsic to NetSuite and ERP systems in general, focusing on:


I am  Kang wang, I will be talking about ERP in the modern workplace. so what is the erp system ? erp stand for Enterprise resource planning (ERP) is business process management software. in other words, it is a tool for managing information. so how do you organize information in your busineess? I bet you have customer database (CRM) and something manageing your orders or warehouse, an accounting system, but none of thesee talk to each other they don't share data. it is what people call islands of information which impacts efficiency. but efficiency is connected to time and money.   erp  can compraise with customer service (CRM system), accounting distribution system. 

1. Benefits of ERP system

data integration ( data entered once into one databaese):

eg, my company Fliway logictics and transporsation company have order management system and warehouse management system (WMS) and Customer Relationship Managementv (CRM), Accounting system, they don't need consider about data integration using spreadsheet or mutiple data entry team for different system.

2. The importance of good business information

safety and security

find an porblem for your business


eg.

The company's performance declined in the year when I went. During the meeting, the sales department complained that the candidates given by the Human Resource department were of low quality and had little experience. The Human Resource department said that the sales department was poorly managed, the experienced employees were resigned, and the new staff training was insufficient. The sales department complained that the transportation department was too inefficient, resulting in insufficient competitiveness. The customer service responded that the customer responded well.

The data that I and my leaders discussed and obtained from erp, crm, hr, using data visualization, can make everyone clearly see that because the average sales performance is good, although we have a large number of new customers, we lost few experienced salesmen, and lost their big customers. This led to a slight downswing in overall performance. and newer commer sales foucus on getting the new customer, but the revenue is low than perious customers.

as result, I reccommand to raise sales salary to hire experienced sales or give them property tranning.
