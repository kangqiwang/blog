What would you say is your biggest weakness?

So my weakness used to be public speaking, speaking to large group of people. In the past, I’ve struggled slightly with public speaking, however I speak to small group of people.
What I’ve done to overcome that is I spend time with classmate that were really good at it. I practiced it in front of mirror everyday.
Recently, in fact, I did a presentation in classroom to large group of people. The message were clear, I felt confident and got good mark from teacher. I’ve since learned  practising speaking aloud is a good way to prepare before speaking to a large group and improve communication skills in general.
