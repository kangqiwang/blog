# What are your weakness
So my weakness used to be public speaking, speaking to large group of people. In the past, I’ve struggled slightly with public speaking, however I speak to small group of people.

What I’ve done to overcome that is I spend time with classmate that were really good at it. I practiced it in front of mirror everyday.

Recently, in fact, I did a presentation in classroom to large group of people. The message were clear, I felt confident and got good mark from teacher.
