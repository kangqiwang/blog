***What are your strengths?***

I am a team worker in team. In my last role in University, I am part of a software implementation team. We all worked together to plan and manage the implementation schedule, I am good at helping the team to see the big picture and resolving conflict or issues affecting the team's harmony. For the technical aspect, I am good at developing application (website or mobile application) combine with machine learning or artifical intelligent.


***How did you motivate the team?***

I was worked as research assistant in Xi'an university, and my teammates were conflicted with whether rewriting code. two fo programmers insist in rewriting the code due to incomprehensible existing code.

I need to find a way to encourage our team to finish project on time and motivate my team mates.

Encourage the members of my team to fully participate by inviting their input and suggestions on how to do things better. Ask questions, listen to their answers, and, whenever possible, implement their solutions.

ask team mates opinion before setting clear and reasonable goals and planning our work everyday. the important thing listen to their opinion and implement it. it will make my teammates feel the goals is ours, it not personal or team leader's.


I worked as administration assistant in Fliway Logistic. my daily job is to check whether drivers' job has been finished, and fix some problems on database manually. our team has five people usually.
but my teammate leaf due to bereavement and my manager took his annual leave.

our team have to face the emerging situation, and finished our work on time.

we decide on working together instead of working individually. When we worked together, we found it is more effectively than before. meanwhile, we will have dinner together after finishing works.

we can finish our work within 10 hours everyday. and everybody wanted to have dinner early. we got positive feedback from senior manager. I've learned teamwork and hunger is good way to improve the efficiency.



2. Fliway

公司在我去的那一年业绩下滑，在开会的时候， 销售部抱怨 人事部门给的候选人素质不高，经验太少。人事部门反击说是销售部管理不善，有经验的老员工离职严重，新人的员工培训不够。销售部抱怨运输部门效率太低，导致竞争力不足，customer service 回击说顾客反应良好。
我和我的领导经过讨论并且从erp，crm，hr上得到的数据，利用数据可视化，可以让大家清楚的看到，是因为销售平均业绩不错，虽然我们有大量的新顾客，但是我们流失了几个老销售员，并且丢掉了他们的大顾客。导致了整体业绩稍微下划。

The company's performance declined in the year when I went. During the meeting, the sales department complained that the candidates given by the Human Resource department were of low quality and had little experience. The Human Resource department said that the sales department was poorly managed, the experienced employees were resigned, and the new staff training was insufficient. The sales department complained that the transportation department was too inefficient, resulting in insufficient competitiveness. The customer service responded that the customer responded well.

The data that I and my leaders discussed and obtained from erp, crm, hr, using data visualization, can make everyone clearly see that because the average sales performance is good, although we have a large number of new customers, we are lost. Several old salesmen, and lost their big customers. This led to a slight downswing in overall performance. and newer commer sales foucus on getting the new customer, but the revenue is low than perious customers.

as result, I reccommand to raise sales salary to hire experienced sales or give them property tranning.

客户提出新的需求想要
one day customer proposal a new demand about their work based on route optimisation based on salesforce.
because most of our customer is in pest control and water hygiene industry, so they need send their employee to customer's location every day .they would like to have a route optimisation system to save their money and time by planning the most efficient route. but it quite complex than we expected because we have a different type of visits and different resources, specific arrival time. 
my strategy is using the agile principle to develop a simple demo version and then Iterate it. during this my iterate, I keep connecting with our customer and manager to keep up their different demands. because it is too complex, sometimes I discuss with my lecture to make sure if there are some cutting edge technology I can use.
as a result, I finished route optimisation version 1 . and made good friends with my colleague and academic staff.

code reviewer


I have no idea about code review, when I first went to the company. I was confused about what should I reviews during the code reviews. But my senior manager encourages and empower me to ask questions and make suggestions on anyone’s code. I still remembered the first time I pulled our repository and test it manually to make sure it meets the requirements, and understand the meaning of the code. I asked lots of question about our code and the big pictures of the system before colleagues preparing going home or going to the office in the morning

 I usually spend 40 mins reviewing of 200-400 lines, if it too long and taking too much time, it is difficult to focus on reviewing the code. Because code reviews should be in a reasonable quantity

 It can be useful to read others’ comment, the comment will provide a reasonable solution and suggestions. It will provide the reason why you would like to pass or fail the code. it will much easier to catch the errors that I don’t find one because it is much easier to check your comment if my comment is completed or corrected

All the developer in our company should annotate code before the review occurs because annotations guide the reviewer through the changes, showing which files to look at first and defending the reason behind each code modification. It avoids wasting people’s time.

By developing my code review skill, I feel confident in the working environment, and avoid a number of bugs from our collogue.

test-driven development

 1. write a unit test describing an aspect of the program. 2. Then, run the test, which should fail because the program lacks that feature. 3. Refactor the code until it conforms to the simplicity criteria. 4. Repeat it again


image similarity

 I was confused about how to compare with two images and return the similarity score. When I started research on this project, I feel relax and glad.Because I learnt feature extraction from an image in Visual Computing. Dr.Sun teaches us edge detection, corner detection and scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) in university. But  I research an advanced method called oriented Fast and rotated Brief, which is better than SIFT.  I use feature extraction and image processing theory into my project.

I learnt new skills and stand out because I’ve taken the time to solve a company problem. I introduce image matching into our system combine PHash and ORB algorithm which I research online

 I was excited about applying my knowledge into practice, however, the result is terrible than I expected. I asked my friend who is a PhD student at Cardiff University, she is expert in the image area. I think many times new skills are outside your department or area. To overcome this, I networked personally, talked with other experts about problems. After my friend's advice, I knew where the problem comes from and put my project into the backlog. Because I didn’t have enough data to use machine learning at the moment.

I research a lot of article about image similarity measure algorithm. I want to become an expert in these things and be able to talk about it. The crucial thing is reading, I read most of the current project and their article on the internet 


Monitor system

I set up a data visualization system using Elasticsearch(search engine based on our system), influxDB(time-series database) and Grafana(data virtualization tools). It is because our system contains multiple types of data and some of the data is instant, I set a job to run script helping us sort data out from MongoDB. For monitor our instant crawling data, I introduced influxDB( a time Series Database) to help data more easy to show as a graph. We use Grafana which is open source software for time series analytics for making a beautiful graph. In this way, we can easily iterate rapid product development using agile.
